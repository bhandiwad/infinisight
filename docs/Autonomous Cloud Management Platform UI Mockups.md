# Autonomous Cloud Management Platform UI Mockups

## Overview
This package contains UI mockups for the Phase 1 implementation of the Autonomous Cloud Management Platform. The mockups demonstrate the user interface for managing complex cloud infrastructure across multiple environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, and Sify CI) using AI agents.

## Mockup Screens

1. **Operations Dashboard** - Command center showing real-time status of cloud resources across environments
2. **Agent Studio** - Configuration interface for managing specialized AI agents
3. **Workflow Tracking** - Visual management of multi-agent workflows
4. **Reporting & Analytics** - Performance dashboards with KPIs and insights
5. **Collaboration Interface** - Human-agent collaboration tools

## Design Features

- **Sify Brand Integration** - Consistent with OneSify design language
- **Responsive Design** - Works across desktop and mobile devices
- **Cross-Environment Support** - Unified interface for AWS, Azure, GCP, and Sify CI
- **Human-in-the-Loop Controls** - Strategic approval points throughout the platform

## Navigation Structure

- Consistent left sidebar navigation across all screens
- Contextual sub-navigation for specific features
- Breadcrumb navigation for clear location tracking

## Implementation Notes

- Built using modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Font Awesome for iconography

## Advanced UI Enhancement Recommendations

See the `advanced_ui_enhancements.md` file for detailed recommendations on:
- Infrastructure Topology Visualization
- Context-Aware Dashboards
- Advanced Filtering and Search
- Multi-Environment Management Console
- And more advanced features

## Next Steps

1. Review mockups with stakeholders
2. Prioritize advanced UI enhancements
3. Create detailed technical specifications
4. Begin implementation of core screens
