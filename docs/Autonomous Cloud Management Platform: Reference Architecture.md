# Autonomous Cloud Management Platform: Reference Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the reference architecture for Sify's Prong 3 initiative: an autonomous platform with AI Agents to help manage complex cloud infrastructure. The architecture leverages state-of-the-art agentic frameworks while integrating with Sify's existing tools and services. The platform will initially focus on cloud infrastructure management, with a future phase extending to network managed services.

## Architecture Vision

The Autonomous Cloud Management Platform will provide an intelligent, self-managing layer that sits above Sify's existing cloud infrastructure and tools. It will use AI agents to automate monitoring, incident response, optimization, and management tasks across both Sify CI and hyperscaler environments.
