# Enhanced UI Mockups README

## Overview
This package contains enhanced UI mockups for the Autonomous Cloud Management Platform, focusing on the workflow builder with drag-and-drop functionality and agent creation capabilities. The mockups demonstrate the user interface for managing complex cloud infrastructure across multiple environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, and Sify CI) using AI agents.

## New & Enhanced Mockup Screens

1. **Workflow Builder** - Interactive drag-and-drop interface for creating and editing workflows
   - Drag-and-drop node placement
   - Start/stop/delete/duplicate workflow actions
   - Agent dropdown selection in each workflow node
   - Node library for adding new components
   - Properties panel for detailed configuration

2. **Agent Creation** - Comprehensive interface for creating and configuring agents
   - Basic agent information configuration
   - Capability selection and configuration
   - MCP (Multi-Cloud Platform) integration
   - A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication setup
   - Advanced settings including prompts and execution parameters

3. **MCP & A2A Integration Guide** - Detailed documentation on integration points and UI flow
   - Multi-Cloud Platform integration points and UI flow
   - Agent-to-Agent communication configuration
   - Visual design elements for cloud providers and agent communication
   - Implementation guidelines

## Design Features

- **Sify Brand Integration** - Consistent with OneSify design language
- **Interactive Elements** - Drag-and-drop functionality for workflow creation
- **Cross-Environment Support** - Unified interface for AWS, Azure, GCP, and Sify CI
- **Agent Communication** - Visual representation of agent-to-agent interactions

## Navigation Structure

- Consistent left sidebar navigation across all screens
- Contextual sub-navigation for specific features
- Breadcrumb navigation for clear location tracking
- Tab-based organization of complex configuration screens

## Implementation Notes

- Built using modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Drag-and-drop functionality would be implemented using libraries like jsPlumb or a custom solution
- Agent configuration forms designed for maximum flexibility and extensibility

## Next Steps

1. Review enhanced mockups with stakeholders
2. Prioritize implementation of drag-and-drop workflow builder
3. Develop agent creation and configuration screens
4. Implement MCP and A2A integration points
