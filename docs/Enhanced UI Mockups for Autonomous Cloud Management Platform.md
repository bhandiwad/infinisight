# Enhanced UI Mockups for Autonomous Cloud Management Platform

This package contains enhanced UI mockups for the Autonomous Cloud Management Platform, with a focus on integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication, and explainability features. All mockups follow the Sify design language and provide comprehensive navigation between screens.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Workflow Builder
- **Drag-and-drop functionality** for creating and editing workflows
- **Action buttons** for start/stop/delete/duplicate operations
- **Agent dropdown selection** in each workflow node
- **Explainability panels** showing reasoning behind workflow decisions
- **Visual workflow status indicators** for real-time monitoring

### 2. Agent Studio
- **Agent creation interface** with step-by-step configuration
- **MCP configuration** for context window, memory retention, and context sources
- **A2A communication settings** for inter-agent messaging
- **Explainability controls** for reasoning transparency and audit trails
- **Capability selection** with visual indicators for MCP and A2A features

### 3. Collaboration Interface
- **Explainable agent communications** with reasoning toggles
- **A2A communication visualization** showing agent interactions
- **Human-in-the-loop approval requests** with clear reasoning
- **Context panels** showing information sources used by agents

### 4. Navigation & Theme
- **Consistent Sify branding** across all screens
- **Fully linked navigation** between all platform components
- **Dark blue/teal sidebar** with white icons matching OneSify design
- **Clean white content areas** with consistent typography

## How MCP and A2A Work Together

The UI demonstrates how Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication complement each other:

- **MCP** provides context enrichment and reasoning capabilities for individual agents
- **A2A** enables communication between specialized agents for collaborative problem-solving
- **Workflow** provides structure and governance for complex multi-agent processes

## Explainability Features

All screens include explainability features that make agent reasoning transparent:

- **Reasoning toggles** to show/hide detailed explanation panels
- **Context indicators** showing what information sources were used
- **A2A communication logs** displaying inter-agent messages
- **Decision justification** explaining why specific actions were taken
