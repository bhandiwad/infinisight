## Strategic Context

Sify's Prong 3 initiative aims to build a very niche managed services platform using AI agents to autonomously manage complex cloud infrastructure deployed on both Sify CI and hyperscalers. The platform will initially focus on cloud infrastructure management, with a future phase extending to network managed services.

The platform will integrate with Sify's existing tools, including:
- ServiceNow for CMDB and ticketing
- Zabbix for monitoring
- CloudInfinit CMP for cloud management
- AIOps Platform for managed services

The vision is to create an autonomous platform similar to Fabrix AI, providing intelligent, self-managing capabilities that enhance Sify's managed services offerings.

## Reference Architecture

## Agentic Framework Selection

After thorough research and analysis of leading agentic frameworks, we recommend a hybrid approach leveraging multiple frameworks:

1. **LangGraph/LangChain (Primary Framework)**
   - Provides deterministic control flow for critical infrastructure operations
   - Handles complex state management and decision trees
   - Enables fine-grained control over agent workflows

2. **CrewAI (Supporting Framework)**
   - Implements role-based agent teams
   - Provides intuitive collaboration model
   - Simplifies implementation of specialized agent roles

3. **AutoGen (Advanced Capabilities)**
   - Used for specific complex scenarios requiring code generation
   - Provides advanced multi-agent conversation capabilities
   - Enables sophisticated problem-solving for complex incidents

This hybrid approach allows us to leverage the strengths of each framework while mitigating their weaknesses, creating a robust and flexible autonomous cloud management platform.
