 instances, storage, networking, containers, scaling groups, and services. In addition they want to understand how much
 cloud waste there is in each category. They used to use scripts and manual methods to figure these out, and each time it
 would take them months.

SAVE CLOUD COSTS ON NON-PRODUCTION
ENVIRONMENTS
 Customer scenario: The DevOps team leaves their non-production cloud instances on 24/7. Research shows that these
 instances are sitting idle about 76% of time on average. The company needs an automated way to start up and shut down
 the instances at proper times.

                                                        With Sify Multi-CMP FinOps

                                                               for smart startup and shutdown schedules.
                                                          ●    These startup and shutdown schedules can be
                                                               applied on individual instances or a group of

                                                          ●    These schedules, once applied, automatically
