## Design Guidelines

1. **Consistent Design Language**
   - Use a consistent color scheme (blues and grays with accent colors)
   - Maintain uniform typography and iconography
   - Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes

2. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast
   - Include alternative text for images
   - Support keyboard navigation
   - Design for screen readers

3. **User Experience**
   - Prioritize clarity and simplicity
   - Ensure intuitive navigation
   - Provide contextual help
   - Include confirmation for critical actions

4. **Technical Considerations**
   - Design for web-based implementation
   - Consider performance implications
   - Plan for future extensibility
   - Support dark/light mode

## Implementation Approach

Each UI screen will be created as an HTML mockup with CSS styling to represent the final appearance. Interactive elements will be simulated where appropriate to demonstrate functionality.

The mockups will be organized in a logical folder structure and compiled into a single package for presentation to stakeholders.
